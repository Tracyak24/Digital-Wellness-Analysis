# Digital Wellness Analysis

# 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between social media usage and mental health using a dataset of 500 users. Through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning, I identified that screen time explains over 50% of mental health variation, making it the dominant factor in digital wellness. The analysis provides data-driven recommendations for healthier digital habits and improved mental wellbeing.

# 🎯 Business Impact

• **Mental Health Optimization**: Reduce stress and increase happiness through targeted interventions

• **Digital Wellness Programs**: Develop evidence-based screen time management strategies

• **Platform Guidance**: Inform users about platform-specific mental health impacts

• **Preventive Care**: Identify at-risk users for early intervention

# 🔍 Objectives

• Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on digital habits and mental health metrics

• Identify correlations between screen time, lifestyle factors, and mental wellbeing

• Build machine learning models to predict happiness and stress levels

• Analyze platform-specific effects on user mental health

• Generate actionable insights for digital wellness improvement

# 📈 Key Results

• **Screen Time Dominance**: Explains 54.6% of happiness and 64.5% of stress variation

• **Model Performance**: Random Forest achieved 47.3% accuracy for happiness and 51.0% for stress prediction

• **Strong Correlation**: Screen time vs Stress (r = 0.740) - very strong relationship

• **Strategic Insights**: Sleep quality boosts happiness; digital detox reduces stress

• **Data Scope**: 500 users analyzed across 6 social media platforms

# 🛠 Tools & Technologies

• **Python Data Stack**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

• **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, Random Forest, feature importance analysis

• **Data Analysis**: SQL, Excel, statistical analysis, correlation studies

• **Development**: Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub

• **Visualization**: Correlation heatmaps, feature importance plots, platform comparisons
